This project provides an OpenCL implementation of the Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) algorithm.

This implementation of SURF has been developed by the [NUCAR](http://www.ece.neu.edu/groups/nucar) group at Northeastern University and AMD.

A high level overview of the implementation of SURF has been described in the paper
